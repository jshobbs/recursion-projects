# recursion-projects
This repository contains many recursion projects. While these projects could have their own repository, 
they are being grouped together because they all involve recursion.

Each of these projects will be built with Maven. All projects will use the Spring framework and use JUnit 4
for testing.

The projects will start off with a command line display, but over time the display will be changed to 
HTML5 on Angular SPA site.
