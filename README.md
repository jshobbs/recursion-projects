# recursion-projects
## Assortment of Recursion Projects
This repository contains many recursion projects. While these projects could have their own repository, 
they are being grouped together because they all involve recursion.

This repository will be part of an application that will show users how recursion works, allowing the
user to step through the execution of a recursive method without needing debug features of an IDE.

The projects will start off with a command line display, but over time the display will be changed to 
an Angular SPA.

These projects are done in Java. To run project, open the project in a Java IDE and run. For a JAR file,
just change IDE settings to create a JAR file at next compile time. Then just run the JAR file.

Recursion projects part of the repository:
* Fibonnaci
* Factorial
* Palindrome
* Reverse String
