# recursion-projects
## Assortment of Recursion Projects
This repository contains many recursion projects. While these projects could have their own repository, 
they are being grouped together because they all involve recursion.

The projects will start off with a command line display, but over time the display will be changed to 
HTML5 on Angular SPA site.

These projects are done in Java. To run project, open the project in a Java IDE and run. For a JAR file,
just change IDE settings to create a JAR file at next compile time. Then just run the JAR file.
